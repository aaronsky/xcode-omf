# xcode-omf

A plugin for Oh My Fish that provides some handy Xcode utilities. Ports some helpers from the [Oh My Zsh][oh-my-zsh] [xcode plugin][omz-xcode-plugin], and provides some new ones of its own.

## Install

```fish
$ omf install xcode
```

## Usage

### xc

Opens the first xcworkspace/xcodeproj matched in the specified directory. You can pass a directory if you'd like, otherwise it defaults to the current working directory. Returns 1 if it fails to find anything.

```fish
$ xc
```
